refactor(config): Remove unneeded initrd_file from distro config

This commit refactors the distribution configuration by removing the `InitrdFile` field from the `ArchInfo` struct in `internal/config/config.go` and its corresponding entries in `distros.yaml`.

For Fedora, the path to the initrd file (`images/pxeboot/initrd.img`) is now hardcoded directly within the `FedoraExtractor` in `internal/distro/fedora.go`.

This change simplifies the `distros.yaml` configuration by removing a field that was only relevant to a specific distribution's extraction logic and was not universally applicable.
