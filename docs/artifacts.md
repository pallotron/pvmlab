# Artifacts Directory

All files generated by `pvmlab` are stored in a hidden directory in your home folder to keep the project's working directory clean.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

```shell
~/.pvmlab/
├── configs/        # Generated cloud-init ISO files (.iso) for each VM
├── docker_images/  # Docker images saved as .tar files to be shared with the provisioner VM
├── images/         # Downloaded Ubuntu cloud image templates
├── logs/           # VM console logs
├── monitors/       # QEMU monitor sockets for interacting with the hypervisor
├── pids/           # Process ID files for running VMs
├── ssh/            # Generated SSH key pair (vm_rsa, vm_rsa.pub) for VM access
└── vms/            # VM disk images (.qcow2) created from the base images
```
